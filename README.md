Bootcamp Module 2 Challenge: VBA-challenge 

## Overview of the project
This VBA script allows you to analyze stock data for a given year, calculate various metrics, and highlight positive and negative changes using conditional formatting. 
The script loops through each worksheet in a workbook, retrieves and stores the necessary data, and provides the following information for each Ticker symbol:

Yearly change from the opening price to the closing price

Percentage change from the opening price to the closing price

Total stock volume

the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume" ticker for each year.
